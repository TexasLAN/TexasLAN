                        <p>I enjoy digital design, knitting, animals, napping, films, and coffee. When I’m not in bed on my laptop with no pants and all the lights off, you can find me petting the closest dog. I also play viola and guitar. I’m all about exploring Austin and spending way too much money on food. I love being a part of LAN and can’t wait to see what’s in our future!</p>

                        <p>Hey! I love all things tech, food, and outdoors. You can find me organizing hackathons, playing video games, or (most likely) lurking on Slack. I joined LAN my freshman year and have since met some of my best friends. LAN is special to me since it provides such a loving community made up of so many unique people. I'm excited for the year ahead and can't wait to see where it takes us!</p>

Nothing makes me happier than a building something cool and implementing an idea. Knowing that I'm contributing to such a tight knit community drives my love for LAN, because Lambda Alpha Nu believes in Lambda Alpha You.</p>

LAN’s the best decision I made in college and has helped forge some of the closest friendships I have. If you ever need to find me, just look for the aux cord. I’m probably close by.</p>

                        <p>Computer science is a real passion of mine, mostly because anyone can easily pickup personal projects and learn from the many resources online. I’m also really interested in math, specifically number theory and game theory. When I’m not all serious about school or work, I enjoy hanging out with friends, trying new food around the city, watching Anthony Bourdain, and playing a lot of games or sports. I’m glad I joined LAN because it’s a well rounded community of people who helpful and caring, and always down for some fun together.</p>

San Antonio is where I grew up and where my two English Springer Spaniel puppers reside, so I will always have love for the 210. To me, LAN is a close knit, loving family in the sometimes cold and all of the time competitive field of CS.</p>
